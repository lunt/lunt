#Lunt

Lunt is an asset pipeline and build system for games.

Lunt is an incremental, cross platform build system that allows you to compile asset data in managed code (i.e. C# or C++/CLI). The API for building components resemble the one that can be found in the [XNA Content Pipeline](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff827626.aspx) or the [MonoGame Content Processing framework](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame/wiki/MonoGame-Content-Processing), but unlike these two, the output file is not tied to a specific format, and the hosting model is interchangeable.

Lunt is cross platform and designed to work on:

* Windows (Windows 7 and later)
* Linux
* OS X

##Binaries
